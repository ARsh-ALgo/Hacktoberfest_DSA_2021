# Basic Queue Operation Implementation using C

In this tutorial, we will see how we can implement a queue using C.
Before we move on towards the code,let us get familiar with the concepts and terminologies used in a queue.



# Introduction to Queue:
A queue is a linear data structure which consists of a Front End and Rear End.

Queue follows the principle of **First-In-First-Out[FIFO]**.

- There are two important pointers called as front and rear.
- The front points to the front end of the queue whereas rear points to the rear end of the queue.
- Value of both front and rear is -1;if the queue is empty.
- Insertion in a queue is known as **enqueue** whereas deletion in an queue in known as **dequeue.**
- We can only dequeue/delete elements from the front end and we can only enqueue/insert elements from the rear end.
